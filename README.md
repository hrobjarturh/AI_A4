Reinforcement Learning - MDP

# Simple Recurrent Networks
## Notebook: AI_A4_MDP.ipynb
The notebook contains 2 classes.  
The first class random_mdp uses a random policy to compute the value function for the floor plan and prints out the results.  
The second class optimal_mdp computes the optimal value function as well as the optimal policy and prints out the results.
### Libraries needed for compiling:
To run this notebook, the user is expected to have NumPy installed on their machine.
### Running:
If all libraries are installed, the user can run the notebook in its entirety from start to finish.
